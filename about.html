      About SA2C
    </h1>
    <p>
      Swansea Academy of Advanced Computing (SA2C) is an Academic Academy
      that supports research making use of High-Performance Computing (HPC)
      and other advanced computing technologies.
    </p><p>
      We do this in a number of ways. Firstly, we have a team of Research
      Software Engineers (RSEs) dedicated to enabling you to run your software
      on HPC, and to make it run faster. Secondly, we manage the University's
      HPC resources, including hosting clusters in our datacentres.
    </p>

    <h1>
      About the RSEs
    </h1>
    <p>
      The RSE team at SA2C can help with a variety of aspects of utilising HPC.
      Some examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Grant application preparation</b>:
	If you are applying for a grant for a project that will require HPC,
	and you need to evidence that your software is ready to run on it,
	we can run scaling tests and provide a detailed benchmark report to
	evidence your application. If your application is not yet ready to run
	on HPC, we can assist with the process of porting the application so
	it will.
      <li><b>Onboarding</b>:
	If you have computational work that is slow enough to be a barrier
	to the research outputs when run on your desktop, but don't know where
	to start moving to HPC, talk to us and we can provide assistance and
	guidance with this process. Frequently this is not as difficult or
	daunting a task as it might seem!
      <li><b>Performance tuning</b>:
	If you already have applications making use of HPC that you need to run
	faster, we can work with you to profile and tune your application's
	performance to make most efficient use of the available hardware.
	Since starting in October, the team has already delivered increases in
	throughput of between 10 and 200% on applications we have worked on.
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you are interested in high-performance or technical computing, we also run
      a <a href="/seminar">technical seminar series</a>, in which we discuss a wide
      range of technically-oriented topics.

      About Supercomputing Wales
    </h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://supercomputing.wales/">Supercomputing Wales</a> is a
      project funded by the ERDF through WEFO to increase the research output
      of Wales through an investment in HPC. This includes funding new clusters
      in Cardiff and Swansea, and hiring RSE teams in Aberystwyth, Bangor, Cardiff,
      and Swansea. Swansea's component of the project is delivered by SA2C.
    </p>
    <p>
      New hardware is currenly nearing the end of the procurement process and will
      be installed in the coming months.
